AJAX(Asynchronous Javascript): Javascript is normally synchronous and single threaded lanaguage. synchronous executes code one after the other and single threaded means execute only one code at a time
  console.log("hi")
  console.log("bye")

  Asynchronous Javascript allows to execute code , not immediately. Asynchronous Javascript allows to execute only specific code with interrupting other codes(UI).
  eg: adding item to cart or score update in crickbuzz etc..,

  We can use browser default timers to understand AJAX. Browser provides two default methods called
     i. setTimeOut
     ii. setInterval


i. setTimeOut : it is used to perform a task after a specific time
   setTimeOut(callback function , time in ms)
   eg: setTimeOut(()=>console.log("hello world"),1000)
    it prints hello world after 1s
    In case if any other code is next to it , it will get executed immediately.

ii . setInterval : it is used to perform a task every time of specific interval
     setInterval (callback function, time in ms)
     eg:setInterval(()=>console.log("hello world"),1000)
     it prints hello world for every 1s

we can stop these methods using clearTimeout and clearInterval
   clearTimeout(variable of setTimeOut)
   clearInterval(variable of setInterval)
