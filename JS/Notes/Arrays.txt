Arrays: Array is a collection of elements. Arrays are represented by square brackets and maintain address of every element as 'index'. indexes starts from 0
   Arrays are like a hotel with multiple rooms contains each element in a room and each room have a number. room numbers starts from 0.
   eg: let arr = [5,9,6,7,3];
console.log(arr[20]) //undefined
arr[20]= 49;
console.log(arr) // total 21 values will be there

Array Methods: 
     1. length :  length returns the total number of elements(last value index+1) in the Array
     console.log(arr.length);
     2.push(values) : it is used to add elements to the end of the Array
     3.pop(): it is used to remove element at the end of the Array
     4. unshift(values) : it is used to add elements to the starting of the Array
     5. shift() : it is used to remove the first element of the array(starting elment of the array)
     6. splice : it is used to add element at any index and delete elements at any index
        splice(starting_index,deleteCount,InsertingValues);
    let arr = [5,6,7,8];
    arr.splice(1,2)   // 6  and 7 will be deleted 5 and 8 remains
    arr=[5,6,7,8];
    arr.splice(1,0,11,12,13); //[5,11,12,13,6,7,8];

    let friends = ["sheldon","monica","rachel","ross","phoebe","shinchan"];
      1. delete shinchan and add "joey"
      2. delete "sheldon" and add "chandler"
      3. add name "emma" between rachel and ross


    7. forEach (callbackfunction(ele,ind))
       forEach is used to pass a callbackfunction to each and every element of the array and for every time , it will accept element and index 
       let arr = [5,4,9,8];
       arr.forEach(function(e,i){
        consolog(e)
        })
   // use forEach and print each elements cube in given array
   let arr = [5,4,9,8];
   arr.forEach(function(ele,ind){
      console.log(ele**3)
   })
  8. map(callbackfunction(ele,ind)):
      map is used to pass a callbackfunction to each and every element of the array and return a value for each and every element of the array.
      eg: let arr= [5,4,6,3]
     let x= arr.map((e,i)=>{
         return e*e;
      })
    console.log(x); //[25,16,36,9]

    9. filter is also similar to map but it returns only the elements whose condition is true
     let arr=[5,4,6,3];
let x= arr.filter((e,i)=> e>=5)
    console.log(x); //[5,6]
    
    10. indexOf('ele') : it is used to return the first occurance of element's index

    11. find(callbackfunction(ele,ind)) : works similarly as filter but returns only first element that satisfies the condition
    we can use alternatives findIndex, findLast, findLastIndex

    12. reverse(): it is used to reverse the given array
    13. reduce(callbackfunction(prev,curr),initial_Value) : it is used to find cumulative values in given array
