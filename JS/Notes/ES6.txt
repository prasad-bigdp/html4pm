ES6 : ES stands for ECMAScript. ECMAScript is the standard that js follows. if JS is like a chef, then ECMAScript is a like a recipe book. Every a new features needs to be added to JS, a new version of ES will be released. ES6 released in 2015 also called ES2015. The latest version  is ES2024 or ES15
ES6 actually brought lot of revolutionary features such as
   i. let & const
   ii. template literals
   iii. Arrow Functions
   iv. default parameters
   v. Promises/Async Await
   vi. OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
   vii . destructuring Array/objects
   viii. Rest of the parameters and spread operator
   ix. ES6 Module System


vi. OOP(Object Oriented Programming):
it is a way of writing code
Probelm :  Jack wants six pack
solution1 : wake up early --> hit the gym --> do some exercises --> maintain diet ---> repeat for some year
solution 2 : first build muscles --> build some biceps --> some chest --> do some abs
solution 3: check what needs for six pack --> verify constantly what ypu have --> do what is needed

The third approach explains Object Oriented Programming. it constantly focus on objects
Object is a physical entity which have properties and methods
class is a standard/blueprint of a object . it contains multiple objects so can be called as collection of objects
class Fruit
{
   color;shape;name;taste;
}
apple is an object which is from class Fruit
//To create object we use a keyword new -- to generate dynamic memory
let apple = new Fruit();
let banana = new Fruit()
