ES6 : ES stands for ECMAScript. ECMAScript is the standard that js follows. if JS is like a chef, then ECMAScript is a like a recipe book. Every a new features needs to be added to JS, a new version of ES will be released. ES6 released in 2015 also called ES2015. The latest version  is ES2024 or ES15
ES6 actually brought lot of revolutionary features such as
   i. let & const
   ii. template literals
   iii. Arrow Functions
   iv. default parameters
   v. Promises/Async Await
   vi. OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
   vii . destructuring Array/objects
   viii. Rest of the parameters and spread operator
   ix. ES6 Module System


vi. OOP(Object Oriented Programming):
it is a way of writing code
Probelm :  Jack wants six pack
solution1 : wake up early --> hit the gym --> do some exercises --> maintain diet ---> repeat for some year
solution 2 : first build muscles --> build some biceps --> some chest --> do some abs
solution 3: check what needs for six pack --> verify constantly what ypu have --> do what is needed

The third approach explains Object Oriented Programming. it constantly focus on objects
Object is a physical entity which have properties and methods
class is a standard/blueprint of a object . it contains multiple objects so can be called as collection of objects
class Fruit
{
   color;shape;name;taste;
}
apple is an object which is from class Fruit
//To create object we use a keyword new -- to generate dynamic memory
let apple = new Fruit();
let banana = new Fruit()


//Inheritance : when a class is derived from another class it is called inheritance

class Car
{
    cmodel;mileage;price;
    constructor(a,b,c){
      this.cmodel =a;
      this.mileage =b;
      this.price =c;
    }
}
let obj1 = new Car("tata punch","20kmph",6);
console.log(obj1.mileage) 

class ElectricCar extends Car{
     batteryCapacity;
     constructor(a,b,c,d){
      super(a,b,c);
      this.batteryCapacity = d;
     }
}
let obj2 = new ElectricCar("tesla",20kmph,70,"10hr")


destructuring of objects or arrays:
     let arr = [5,4,6,9];
     let [a,b,c,d] = arr;  // destructuring of array

     let obj = { name :"shekhar",age:55}
     let {name,age} = obj;  // destructuring of object

Rest of the parameters:
        it is represented by three dots and it is used to collect all the rest of parameters and store them as an array. it is always written at last of parameters
        let [a,...b]= ["raj","shekhar","john"]
    console.log(a)  //raj
    console.log(b)  //["shekhar","john"]

Spread operator:
        it is used to spread out the array. it is also represented by three dots
let a =[1,2],b=[3,4];
let c = [...a,...b];
console.log(c) [1,2,3,4];
