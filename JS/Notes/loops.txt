Loops:  Loops are used to iterate certain statements again and again until the condition fails. 
There are two kinds of Loops
   i. Entry control Loops
   ii. Exit control Loops

i. Entry control Loops : These loops are used to check the condition at the starting of loop  and run the statements if the condition is true, once the statements are over, it again check the condition and repeats the process
   eg: while and for

  while : while is an entry control loop which uses condition, updation and initialization in 3 different statements
     syntax:  initialization;
              while(condition)
              {
                //statements
                updation;
              }

  eg: print numbers 1 to 10 using while
          let  i = 1;
          while(i<=10)
          {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
          }
  For : For is also an entry control loop which is used to iterate certain statements by using initialization, condition and updation in the same line
    syntax :  for(initialization;condition;updation){
        // statements
    }
    eg: print alternate letters of given string ( inp : PRASAD, output:P A A);
    for(i=0;i<=x.length-1;i+=2)
    { 
        console.log(x.charAt(i)) 
    }

   let arr = [5,4,3,2,1];
   // write a for loop to print array elements
   for(let i=0;i<=arr.length-1;i++){
    console.log(arr[i])
   }
   This is called standard-for
   But in Javascript there are other variations of for such as 'for..of', for..in'
   for..of: it is used to iterate array elements
    syntax :  for(let i of arrayName){
         //statements
    }
    i will be automatically array elements
   eg: let arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
     for(let i of arr){
        console.log(i);
     }
    for..in: it is used to iterate array indexes/address
    syntax :  for(let i in arrayName){
         //statements
    }
    i will be automatically array indexes
   eg: let arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
     for(let i in arr){
        console.log(i);
     }

do while :  do while is exit control loop which checks the condition at the exit of body . it the condition is true, it repeats the loop else it terminates
   syntax :
   initialization; 
    do {
        //statements
        updation;
   }while(condition);
   eg: print only even numbers between  1 to 20 using do while
   let i = 1;
   do {
      console.log(i);
      i++;
   }while(i<=20);
