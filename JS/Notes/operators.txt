Operators : Operators are used to perform operations. There are different types of Operators such as
  i. Arithematic Operators : + , - , * ,/(direct division), % (remainder) , **(power)
  ii. relational Operators: These Operators are used for comparision
      >  , < , >=, <= ,
      ==   -- it will compare only values not datatypes
      ===  -- it will compares value and datatype
      !=  --  returns negation of ==
      !== -- returns negation of ===
  iii. logical Operators : These Operators are used for combining statements logically
     && (logical and) -- it will return true only if both are true
     || (logical OR) -- it will return true when any one statement is true
     ! (logical NOT) -- it will return true when actual statement is false

  iv. increment and decrement : These are unary operator which is used to increment (increase the value by 1) and decrement(decrease the value by 1)
    pre-increment : it first updates the value and returns it
    post-increment : it first returns the value and updates it.
    similar to decrement also
    b= 10 ; ++b ---> 11
    b=10 ; b++ ---> 10  , b value will becomes 11 later

  v. Ternary Operator or conditional Operator:
      it is the shorthand operator used to check the condition true or false and make a decision based on that value
      let a = 10;
      let c = (a>5) ? 20  : 30 ;

  vi. nullish coalescing operator: it will check two values and return first value if it is not undefined or null, else it returns second value
        let a= 10;
        let b =20;
        let c = a ?? b;
